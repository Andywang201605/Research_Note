# Some useful comments and references with regards to rotation measure

### Simple depolarization
Simple depolarisation: see Appendix A (and Section 4.3) of https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..212...15F/abstract for a nice overview. 
Or see https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998MNRAS.299..189S/abstract  for the terrifying full range of options. 
The physics behind all these mostly relates to galaxies and AGN, but the functional forms should still be representative of broad types of behaviour.

### RM catalogue
The latest/greatest RM catalogue is the one at https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RMTable/blob/master/master_catalog_ver0.1.8.fits. 
I donâ€™t think this yet includes the sources at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3814L/abstract, which are also especially relevant for this source.
